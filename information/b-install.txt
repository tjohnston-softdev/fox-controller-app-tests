This text file aims to give a quick guide as to how the FOX Controller Test Script is installed. If you are reading this, it can be safely assumed that you have either downloaded the source files already or you are browsing them on Bitbucket. Either way, this tutorial is going to start from the beginning and should not take too long to complete.

First, it will be assumed that:

1. You already have a Node JS environment set up in a way that you see fit.

2. You have already cloned or pulled a stable version of the FOX Controller.


After you have those things taken care of, it is time to begin installing the test script:




1. Clone the 'fox-controller-app-tests' project from the Optim Controls Bitbucket repository. The steps to doing so may slightly vary depending on your preferred Git client but as long as you have a URL to the project and relevant access rights, the process should be made quite clear.

One possible URL you can use is:

https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@bitbucket.org/optimcontrols/fox-controller-app-tests.git





2. For now, it does not matter where you download the repository into. That will be covered in the next step. All you need to do now is make sure that the project is in a location you remember, and that the source files ('app', 'backup', etc) are in a folder named 'fox-controller-app-tests'.



3. If you did not end up doing this already, move the 'fox-controller-app-tests' folder so that it is a sibling to 'fox-controller-app'. In other words, those two folders sit in the same root folder
('root/fox-controller-app', 'root/fox-controller-app-tests')

The reason this step is required is because some parts of the test script interact with the FOX Controller files, testing them. The project is built to assume that those two folders are siblings when trying to locate files.



4. Open a command line interface so that it starts in the 'fox-controller-app-tests' folder. Afterwards, run "npm install". This will download and install the dependent Node JS modules. The command line will usually show loading bars but not for every module. It would be best to wait for a few minutes. When it is complete, the command line will display something like "Installed x modules in y seconds"



5. To run the test script after installing, execute "npm test" in 'fox-controller-app-tests'
