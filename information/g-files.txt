* 'app/common-errors.js': This file is used to store error strings and functions that write error strings. The reason some of these errors are stored in this file is so that they can be used by multiple parts of the test script.
Tested in 'test-parts/part-a-common_data/items/itm-common_errors.js'


* 'app/common-objects.js': This file is used to store objects that need to be accessed by multiple parts of the test script. Most of these objects relate to generic Device objects which can be used by the Controller.
Tested in 'test-parts/part-a-common_data/items/itm-common_objects.js'


* 'app/define-api.js': This file stores an array of Manufacturers that are supported by the test script and the Controller. The reason this single array gets its own file is because originally, the definitions in 'define-api' had a much more complex structure than just manufacturer names. In other words, it is a holdover from earlier versions of the test script
Tested in 'test-parts/part-c-internal_scripts/scripts/s-define_api.js'


* 'app/local-valid.js': This file stores functions used for validation that cannot be covered by 3rd-party modules. Most of these use Regular Expressions.
Tested in 'test-parts/part-c-internal_scripts/scripts/s-local_valid.js'


* 'app/request-api.js': This file stores functions related to HTTP requests. While the requesting is performed by a 3rd-party module inside the individual test scripts, these functions are used for preparation and results
Tested in 'test-parts/part-c-internal_scripts/scripts/s-request_api.js'

* 'app/request-api-paths.js': This stores the names of APIs used by the Controller
Tested in 'test-parts/part-c-internal_scripts/scripts/s-request_api_paths.js'


* 'app/supported-databases.js: This file stores 'definitions' of known Databases used by the Controller. Information includes the name, type, and its size when empty

Tested in 'test-parts/part-a-common_data/items/itm-common_functions.js'

* 'app/paths/files/fox-paths.js': This stores the paths to files in the Controller


* 'app/paths/files/sub-common-paths.js': This stores the paths to the contents of 'app/sub-common/files'
