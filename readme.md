# FOX Controller Unit Testing
This is a Node JS application which is used to perform unit testing on a software prototype I helped develop as an employee of [Optim Controls](https://www.optimcontrols.com.au/home) during late-2018. It has the ability to test both the individual script files and the online API endpoints.

## Inspiration
During April 2018, I made contact with Optim Controls and was introduced to their latest project - the FOX Controller In simple terms, a [Programmable Logic Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller) is a device used by the engineering industries to remotely control various machinery such as assembly lines and robotics. 

At first, I was asked to research various technical requirements and determine whether they can be implemented in Node JS. Unfortunately, much of my research was a non-starter so eventually, I was asked to shift my focus to writing unit tests for prototype builds of the Controller software.

At first, I thought it was weird writing software to test software and I'll admit I was sceptical (if not cynical) about the value of it. Then, it was explained to me that by automating the test process as much as possible, it would be easier to detect when things break, where the errors potentially came from, and how they might be fixed.

I do not know the exact date I started working on this project but it was during late-July 2018. My last contribution was on 21st December, which was the date I officially resigned from Optim.

## Further Development
As of April 2021, I have decided that I would clean up my work with Optim and share it publicly for my portfolio. I spent a couple of weeks writing an [Emulator](https://github.com/tjohnston-softdev/fox-controller-app) that simulates the Controller software with as little dependency and overhead as possible.

On the 26th of April, I was finally able to publicly release both the emulator and the original test program. Coincidently enough, this is three years to the day since I first made contact with Optim.

I will be cleaning and revising the test script in the coming months. Once I feel that is ready, I will release an updated version.
